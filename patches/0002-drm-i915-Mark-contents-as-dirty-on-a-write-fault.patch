Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Mark contents as dirty on a write fault
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit b925708f28c2b7a3a362d709bd7f77bc75c1daac upstream.

Since dropping the set-to-gtt-domain in commit a679f58d0510 ("drm/i915:
Flush pages on acquisition"), we no longer mark the contents as dirty on
a write fault. This has the issue of us then not marking the pages as
dirty on releasing the buffer, which means the contents are not written
out to the swap device (should we ever pick that buffer as a victim).
Notably, this is visible in the dumb buffer interface used for cursors.
Having updated the cursor contents via mmap, and swapped away, if the
shrinker should evict the old cursor, upon next reuse, the cursor would
be invisible.

E.g. echo 80 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq ; echo f > /proc/sysrq-trigger
