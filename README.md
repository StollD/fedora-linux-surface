**IMPORTANT: This uses code / configs that are not verified to work by jakeday.**

This is a collection of random scripts and `*.spec` files that I am using to compile kernels on Fedora with [jakedays](https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface) linux-surface patches applied.

For compiled version you can check out my [repository](https://github.com/StollD/fedora-linux-surface-repo) for linux-surface on Fedora.
